# odin-recipes
First project of HTML

This is the first project of my journey to become a Full Stack Developer through TOP.

In this first project I'm going to build a site with recipes to prepare some random dishes.

The goal with this project is to internalize all the lessons about HTML, git and gitHub that I've
done til now. I will create a simple structured websites that will include links, images and lists.
