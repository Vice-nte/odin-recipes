        <p>It's a classic, tastes amazing, it's impossible to screw up (unless you
        burn the bread, please don't), and the most important thing of all: It has cheese
        , the best ingredient in the world and that alone should make it a go to for every
        breakfast.
        </p>
        <p>Come and join me making the best grilled cheese sandwich that you will eat in your life</p>
        <p class = "startingpoint">What you'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of white bread</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cheddar or any cheese that melts you got home</li>
            <li><strong>Secret ingredient:</strong><em> Mayonnaise</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "startingpoint">What to freakin' do:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread a generous amount of butter on both slices of bread. It's easier if you
                have the butter at room temperature or just put it a few seconds on
                the microwave
            </li>
            <li>Add any amount of cheese you want to the bread and close it. Please be
                generous with the cheese or this recipe (and my life) will not make any sense.
            </li>
            <li>Now here come the secret, spread some Mayo on the outside side of 1 of the slices, just one side for now.
                The egg in the mayo is going to make some black magic in the pan that you will thank me later.
            </li>
            <li>Grab a non-stick pan, medium heat and just throw the sandwich with the mayo side on the pan. Don't preheat it, we want
                more time for the cheese to melt and you'll get better results this way
            </li>
            <li>While one side is cooking, spread mayo in the part of the sandwich facing up in the 
                pan
            </li>
            <li>About 3 minutes in (depending on your stove) you should turn around the sandwich.
                If your bread is brownish on the side you just flipped we are good. If not give
                it a little more before the flip.
            </li>
            <li>Wait 3 minutes or less and check the bottom of the bread for that brownish color
                and then remove the sandwich from the pan
            </li>
            <li><em>Voila!</em> Cut it in half and enjoy!</li>
